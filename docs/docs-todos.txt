This  is a little note of some thoughts about the docs and how they ought to be designed better.


1. Sequelize has all these gotchas that annoyingly sneak up on you.
1. The docs surface advanced/edge case topics and bury simple explanations.
1.


Todos

1. Surface emphasis on naming conventions and singular vs. plural convention, capitals etc.
1. Getting started similar to mongoose's (https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html)
1. Simple setup (agnostic to framework, no sequelize-cli) - need to recommend best practice for this.
1. Express and Sequelize-CLI setup (sequelize-it quick start)
1. Rename API "core concepts"
  1. combine model-basics and model-instances
  1. combine querying-basics and query-finders
1. Unique constraint in validations talks about how the model influences the sync call... sync is radioactive.
